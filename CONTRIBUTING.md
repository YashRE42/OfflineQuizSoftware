Please follow camel case syntax with variable declarations.

Collections of objects can be named as "<SINGULAR-OBJECT>s" eg apple class => apples vector.

When sending in PR for fixing an issue, please add the words "fixes XXXX" where XXXX is the issue number so that the issue can be auto-closed.

Workflow:
create fork of project -> clone your fork of the project -> write code -> commit code to your fork -> create pr to this repo.

to make things neat, you can create a branch in your fork from the master, make the commit in the branch and send the pr from that branch to the main, and then make a new branch from the master for a different issue.
